# Multithreading_In_Java
This repository explores the concept of multithreading in Java, showcasing the power and flexibility it brings to concurrent programming. Multithreading enables the execution of multiple threads concurrently, enhancing the performance and responsiveness of Java applications.
## Introduction

Multithreading is a powerful feature in Java that enables the concurrent execution of multiple threads, allowing developers to achieve parallelism and improve the performance of applications. This repository delves into the intricacies of multithreading, covering topics such as thread creation, synchronization, communication between threads, and advanced concepts.
Explore a variety of scenarios related to multithreading in Java, including:
Creating and managing threads using both Thread class and Runnable interface.
Implementing synchronization techniques to avoid data races.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Thread Creation and Lifecycle
- **Description**: Understanding how to create and manage threads in Java.
- **Example**:
  ```java
  class MyThread extends Thread {
      public void run() {
          // Thread logic goes here
      }
  }

  public class Main {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
          MyThread thread = new MyThread();
          thread.start();
      }
  }
